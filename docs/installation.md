## Docker

A somewhat rudimentary Dockerfile has been created and allows for Hashcat to be run in a Docker container with GPU passthrough. 

Fair warning - this has only been tested with Nvidia and Cuda so far and it's recommended you have some experience with Docker.

Basic use is as easy as:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -v cj_data:/data -v cj_instance_data:/opt/web/crackerjack/data -p 8888:8888 brainthee/crackerjack
```

- The `cj_data` volume would store the various wordlist/mash/rules etc directories.
- The `cj_instance_data` volume maps the SQLite database and session data directories to a persistent volume.
- `--gpus all` passes through your GPUs for use. You need a working Docker configuration that supports passthrough. 


## Requirements

* python >= 3.6
    * In python 3.6 onwards dictionaries hold items in the same order you add them. Sounds to me this should have been the deal since version 1.
* screen >= 4.06.00
    * This version of screen onwards has the -Logfile parameter where you can set the output path of the logfile.
* hashcat
    * Any version will do, all supported hashes are dynamically extracted from the --help option.

## Update to Latest Version

If you already have a working installation of CrackerJack, follow the instructions below to get the latest and greatest version:

```
# Stop the web server.
sudo systemctl stop crackerjack

# Switch to the user that owns the files in the installation directory. This is usually the user running the web server.
sudo -u www-data /bin/bash

# Navigate to CrackerJack's install path. 
cd /opt/crackerjack

# Pull the latest code.
git checkout master
git pull

# Activate the virtual environment
. venv/bin/activate

# Install any requirements.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run flask migrations. If you get errors here, it means you are probably logged in as the wrong user.
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

# Restart service. Make sure you exit the `www-data` shell before you run this.
sudo systemctl start crackerjack
```

## Installation

### Ansible

**WARNING**: The Ansible scripts have been tested only against clean installations of the supported operating systems. Be careful if you run them against an environment with non-standard configuration.

Ansible scripts are provided in the `./setup/ansible` directory.

Copy the `vars.yml.template` file to `vars.yml`, follow the instructions within the file to set the appropriate variables, and run against your host:

```
cd ./setup/ansible
ansible-playbook -K crackerjack.yml -v --user <USER_TO_LOGIN_WITH> --ask-pass -i <IP_OR_HOSTNAME_OF_MACHINE>,
```
